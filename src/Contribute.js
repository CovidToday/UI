									<br/><br/>

									<b>Public health experts, Epidemiologists, Journalists, Medicos! Help us write short periodical analyses of the numbers we present</b>

									<b>Software engineers, Data scientists! Build and fine-tune the technological backbone. </b>
									The backend is open sourced on github. Find new issues or have your pick of the existing ones, and help build the code that
									crunches the numbers and oils the pipeline. We are planning on open sourcing the UI too, get in touch if you want to pitch in.
									<br/><br/>

									<b>Public health experts, Data analysts, Epidemiologists, ML experts, all others! Build on the concept. </b>
                  Innovate with us on what indicators to show next, how to better present the data for more insightful conclusions,
                  and how to expand the platform to make it more resourceful. We are also exploring the data we see through ML.
